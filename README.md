# Welcome to this homepage

Hi!  This is the repository for Assignment 1 of Stat 545a.

Here, you'll find:
* This, the readme file
* Why I'm taking this course
* A little about me
* General silliness

## Why I'm taking this course
Never learned how to code of any sort!  My transition into a new-ish position requires these skills (see below).  Excited to learn with all of you!

## A little about me
* By day: I'm now a public health medicine specialty trainee but am also an attending physician.  For this I now need to directly look at data for my work, which is definitely new for me.  Before as a clinician most of us just "outsourced" it to the research teams and used everyone's comparative advantages!
* Also by day: I teach at the UBC medical school for a good portion of my week.  I'm actually trained under another subspecialty for educating physicians.
* By night I work as a family physician.  I guess more like "by nights and weekends."
     * Yes, I work weekends.  Way too many of them...
* **Most importantly**: I'm completely new to coding.  Really looking forward to help from everyone in this class!


Originally I wanted to express my love for dogs by inserting a picture of the cutest samoyed ever (anyone else stare at too many pictures of Maya Polar Bear?), but then I realized it's probably be under copyright.  Actually I wanted to link a **whole bunch** of pictures but I was at a faculty development session on copyright material a few months ago and now I'm trying to be very aware of what is and is not okay.  I guess the sessions accomplished what it need, which was to scare the daylights into us who were using lots of images in our PowerPoints taken directly from google without thinking.  Whoops!


So for now, here's an emoji instead: :dog:
And although I denied it for more than 2 decades, I recently (*medically*) confirmed that I am extremely allergic to dogs so I can't have my own.  :sob:


Let's end it for now with a quote that I live life by, a little too much:
  > Life is short.  Eat dessert first.
